# SQL-Rockbuster-Data-Analysis

### This project was completed as part of the curriculum from the CareerFoundry bootcamp.

## Introduction
#### To stay profitable, Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental company, is shifting its business model. Facing intense competition from streaming service providers, including major players like Amazon Prime and Netflix, Rockbuster Stealth LLC has experienced a significant drop in rental rates. To remain competitive in the market, the goal is to launch an online rental service.

## Purpose
#### This project aims to use query-based analysis (SQL) within Rockbuster's RDBMS to answer key business-related questions, providing valuable insights for various departments involved in this initiative.


## Key Questions and Objectives

- Which categories contributed to the most/least revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
